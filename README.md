Sentiment analysis which is also known as opinion mining extracts the subjective information and identify the positive, negative or neutral opinions in the text. The aim of the study is to develop a supervised model for drug rating prediction. There are three main components of our analysis which are data preprocessing, text feature extraction and classification. The analysis was conducted based on an existing dataset which was scraped from Drugs.com. Two types of feature extraction methods were used which were statistical word counts and vector conversion.
